  <p>At the start of development, I first had to teach myself how to use Unreal Engine, and I did this by watching a YouTube tutorial about how to create a simple first-person shooter. And once I was done with that, I moved on to making the actual platformer itself. While I was making it, I faced some challenges, such as making sure that both the player's health and life system worked. Once I got that all figured out, I moved on to developing the level, which wasn't too bad. Once I finished that, I moved on to getting the UI worked out, which was a bit tough for me due to how I posted my code into the third-person character instead of a game mode. However, once that was all done, I finished and packaged it up, and it can now be played using the link on the home page.   </p>
